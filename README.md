# flask_comment

Simple commenting system based on Flask. Takes in any value of the url and displays the relevent comments. You can, for example, iframe it from your static website.

I will use it for my personal blog hosted on github.

# Usage

Once its up and running (I am running it on free PythonAnywhere.com account), you can call it via a specific endpoint.
Example:
www.FlaskCommentHosted.com/uniquepagid and it will display only comments that correspond to that page.

# Example
http://greatunknown.pythonanywhere.com/helloworld/

- ~~one of row will be commentsectionid (one per comment area)~~
- add recaptcha
- salt hashed values
- pretty it up a bit
